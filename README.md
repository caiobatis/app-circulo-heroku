# Welcome to Sunrise

This is a UI component dev environment for your app.

We've added some basic stories inside the  `src/components/Button/button.stories.js`

 A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want. \(Basically a story is like a visual test case.\)

 Just like that, you can add your own components as stories. You can also edit those components and see changes right away. \(Try editing the Button stories located at `{'src/components//.stories.js'}` .\)

 Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app. Have a look at the {' '} [Writing Stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/writing-stories/) {' '} section in Storybook documentation.

  NOTE:
  Have a look at the .storybook/webpack.config.js to add webpack loaders and plugins you are using in this project.
